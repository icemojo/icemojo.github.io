It's been a while since I've last talked about this project, so much so that people might assume I've already abandoned it. Quite contrary actually, I'm still very much knee deep into development. The game was supposed to be wrapped up within fourty more hours or so after the [last post][broughlike-intro-part-02], which is essentially about two weeks of work. The reason why that's not happening yet is a lot of things have been going on in my life and I couldn't get much dev hours as I would've wanted. Important life event, failed game jams and difficult job hunting experiences occupied my time a lot over the last two months. Now that I've just wrapped up one of the big features a couple of days ago, I figured it's as good as time as any to check in before I proceed. 

So, first of all...

# It's getting dark, baby!

Yup, the entire color scheme of the dungeon has been changed into a darker tone. The main reason was, well, it's supposed to be a dungeon filled with scary monsters and shifting floors. The previous yellowy color scheme just feels like you're strolling through an ancient, faraway, desert temple. Which works fine by itself, but the vibe I wanted to go for is quite similar to Diablo 2, where you just couldn't know what dangers or riches await on every descent. 

Plus, the player is now a green viking dude holding an axe, which will probably never get used in the entire game. The previous blue alien-like guy with a pot belly is now revamped into an enemy monster with it's own special ability. We'll talk more about him in a minute. For now, I'll touch a little bit on one of the new spells.
