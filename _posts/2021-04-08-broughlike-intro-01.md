About a month ago, I stumbled upon [this nice little tutorial series](https://nluqo.github.io/broughlike-tutorial/), which plays on a very niche sub-genre of the Roguelike games called "Broughlikes". For those of you who don't know what "Roguelike" means, I'll trust your ability to Google stuffs in order to respect the time of those who do. But if you're not really into Roguelike games at all, I suppose this article will mostly just bore you. 

So, the term Broughlike was named after an indie developer, Michael Brough, who created a series of charming, weird games like [Imbroglio](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/imbroglio/id969264934) and [868-Hack](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/868-hack/id635749911). Imbroglio has actually been one of my favorite and longest standing game on my phone ever since I saw [this Gamasutra article](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/273314/Freedom_through_constraints_The_design_of_Michael_Broughs_Imbroglio.php) a few years ago. Back then, even though I was immediately hooked with the game after I bought it, I only took it as a small Roguelike game with interesting puzzle elements. Nothing more. That is, of courese, until I discovered the tutorial series mentioned above. 

There are a few key characteristics to Broughlike games but the main premise that stuck around in my head for so long (after reading the Gamasutra article) was the concept of "small worlds" in a relatively confined grid with turn-based controls. There are a couple of other games that came into my mind which has similar properties to it (The Nightmare Coorperative being one of them, Crypt of the Necrodancer being another) but they mostly focus on the idea of Roguelikes rather than smallish, confined worlds. I've always wanted to play with the idea myself too, but never been able to get into it. Mostly because I didn't know where to start, how to design the mechanics or how things simply just fit together in a tiny space. The tutorial finally gave me a good jump start.
