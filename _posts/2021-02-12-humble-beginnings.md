`INTRO`

The very first post of me deciding to start writing seriously, and I'm already hitting a block. 

This really feels like writing an introductory section in an academic paper without having any clues on what the paper is going to be about. I have a ton of ideas of post topics for sure, but I really don't know at this point in time how I'm going to present them in a meaningful way.

`MEATS`

Maybe I should probably start with *why* I'm putting out a blog in today's day and age of the modern time where the Internet is densely saturated with endless consumables in the forms of websites, blogs and YouTube channels which come in a very wide spectrum of goodness.

Well, I've been seriously thinking a lot about this for a few months now, and there are several reasons behind for finally managed to kick this off. I'll break them down bit by bit. The thing is, this isn't my first attempt to write at all. In fact, there were several tries over the past ten years or so, and none of them actually sticked. 

The last thing I want to do, of course, is to add another drop in this endless sea of resources for people to waste their time on, which kinda leads me to the first and most important point.

# Stuffs I put out there should prove to be useful to at least *one* person

When I first gave this "writing" thing a try while I was in college (and eventually gave up after three seconds), the main hurdle I experienced was, "Why would anyone care?" I wasn't really experienced enough to explain anything useful about any particular topics in question. And even if I wrote something interesting enough, there are an infinite better ways for people to learn about it elsewhere. About a decade has passed, I've gathered a tiny bit more experience than before, both in professional and personal life, and I still have that thought lingering in the back of my head. But there's one important thing I've learned as well: *it doesn't really matter*.

It doesn't matter whether something you've put out there is useful to someone else or not. It doesn't matter whether a particular piece of knowledge you blogged about is good or bad. It doesn't matter the way you've solved a very particular piece of problem in a very specific way will help someone out there to avoid falling into the same pitfalls. Because you don't define the "usefulness" of the knowledge you've shared to others. It is the receiving end who will evaluate whether it was actually worthwhile to spend time listening, watching or reading your stuffs. It is the readers and viewers who will decide whether your work is good or bad. If they find it useful to them, they will show their appreciation one way or the other (if they feel like it). If people already know about what you're talking about, they will simply move on (unless they've got infinite time in their hands and love to spend their life criticizing other people's works). 

The point is, it doesn't matter what you say or write. Good or bad, usefulness or useless, simple or complex, they're all relative and subjective. You might assume that your facts may be extremely mundane. But there will always be someone who doesn't know enough about a topic and reading what you've shared will push them towards the next step in their journey. You might be writing something incredibly complex about a particular topic and think that there's nobody nerdy enough to read about it. Believe you me, there's always someone who wandering around the Internet researching about the same topic. The important part is simply to have confidence in your own work. 

I suppose it's best to sum this up by quoting the [Butterscotch Shenanigans podcast][bscotch-podcast]:

>It's always worth sharing something you felt like you've learned quite enough, even though it may not be much.

# I just like writing... or at least, I think I do


# So... what am I gonna write about? 

A few topics at the top of my head at the moment. 

- **Programming, coding and development related stuffs** - I'm not going to bore anyone with lenghty tutorials. The Internet already has enough resources to be discovered on *how* to do various stuffs using various languages and frameworks in order to achieve a variety of objectives. Instead, I'll try to focus on a few things that walk the fine line between very unique to certain situations and are not common enough to be able to easily Google about. If this sounds a little bit confusing to you, believe me, it does for me too. I just hope I can do a better job at explaining things when I actually get down to it.
- **System design and architecture** - Again, I'm not going towards tutorials, or quoting wiki pages and text books. Instead, I'll try to point out interesting abstracts on particular design patterns and maybe how to apply them practically in the real world scenarios. Because one thing I find lacking in most of the theoritical references is... well, they're mostly theoritical. For instance, a lot of people know very well about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) patterns, but they don't know or invest that much time in UML modeling which is in fact the root of all OOP patterns. In other words, if you work a little bit more on your grammer, you might get a little bit better with speaking or talking to other people in general. 
- **Game dev** - A programmer by day and game developer by night, that's usually the tagline I use to introduce myself. But I'm not what you might call a *good* game developer, not by a long shot. I've been doing this for about four years now and all I can show off as part of my work is a collection of crappy games I've put out on [my itch.io page][icemojo-itch-page], and a whole bunch of dead prototypes rotting in various places of digital storage. Still, I'll try to take you on this journey and show you the ins and outs, and ups and downs of designing and making video games as a hobby. As I wrote about the journalling above, this will be my own historical record of progression (or lack thereof) for me to look back as much as time killer contents for you to read.
- **Dev logs** - These could be about making games either short or long term, game jam experiences or even some other quirky, weird projects I dive into on a whim from time to time. 
- **Minecrafting, gaming and game reviews** - 

Plus, sci-fi, fictions and a bunch of other stuffs that I'm usually passionate about or simply pique my interest, and may or may not do the same to you too. 



`CONCLUSION`

Stuffs that I feel like I learned, not much, but quite enough about and supposedly worth sharing.
