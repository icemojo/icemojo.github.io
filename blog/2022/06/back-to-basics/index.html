  <div class="post-body">
    <p>Back when I was about 14 or 15 years old, I remember a time where I only had a couple of allowance hours per day having access to a computer, so that I can do whatever I want. So that I could read, browse very limited Internet capability, practice rudimentary coding and get a taste of what the future might hold. I don't remember much about the things I was doing on a limited access computer, but I do have a very distinct memory of not having enough time to do all the things I want to do, especially when it comes to programming and making stuffs. I vaguely remember one time where I was working through a Java e-book, and there's one section in the book where it teaches you how to program a game in Java Applet (anyone remember Java Applets?) and run it in the browser. I can't even recall what the game was about, but the very distinct memory I still have is the feeling of pure creativity, the joy of building your own little world and have a little dude run around in it. I couldn't get enough of it.</p>
<p>The second time I experienced that feeling was during when I was in college.</p>
<p>Intentions, attentions:</p>
<ul>
<li>for someone who came from the almost-decade-long experience of primarily solving business problems and delivering products to the end users (i.e., having to prioritize the business costs over pretty much everything else), I want to get a bit more intimate understanding of the craft, the software, the art that I'm creating alongside a bit more proficiency in handling the tools to produce those crafts (at least within the next coming ten years)</li>
<li>focus more deeply on the fundamentals of designing and building something, building software; the quality, the performance, the attention to details. the profound understanding of ones craft to something minute even as adding a number to another number (one particular action to this; moving away from object-oriented languages)</li>
<li>imposter syndrome? -- am I not capable, to tackle all those challenges that I always dream of tackling? or rather, is this the only extend I'm capable of? am I actually lacking the ability to access or understand the depth of a particular subject, especially those related to my professional area (programming, game dev, game design, art, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Which resulted in:</p>
<ul>
<li>not being wanted to get limited by the capabilities of those proprietary off-the-shelf tools, and being at the mercy of their heavy abstractions </li>
<li>software is young after all. game design, game development field is even younger, and still quite a distance away from maturity. there's no special need to rush towards, or race against anything else. don't be a consumer, be a creator. there's still a lot of areas left to explore. there isn't just one fundamental right way to create something.</li>
<li>the more I learn about the art of my craft (programming, game design, or even tech in general), the more I feel like I'm less competent in giving constructive, concrete (or even correct) advice to someone who has less experience than me</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to be a programmer and a game designer -- who has a profound, fundamental understanding of their profession and their craft.</p>
<p>Yet, I'm experiencing a serious flickering problem with the Lektor admin panel editor. This makes it all the more harder to jot down my thoughts on paper.</p>
